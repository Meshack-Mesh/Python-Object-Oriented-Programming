# 🎓 Assignment 1 & Activity 2 – OOP in Python


This project demonstrates the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python through two parts:

1. **Assignment 1 – Class Design with Inheritance & Encapsulation**
2. **Activity 2 – Polymorphism Challenge**

## 📁 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class – Musical Instrument 🎸

In this section, we designed a class structure for **Musical Instruments**. The main features include:

- A **base class**: `Instrument`
- Two **derived classes**: `Guitar` and `Drum`
- **Encapsulation** of attributes using underscores (`_`)
- **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** shown through overridden methods like `play_sound()`

Each object is initialized using a **constructor** (`__init__`) and has a unique set of values.

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge – Animals

This part demonstrates **polymorphism** using a base class `Animal` and subclasses:

- `Fish` → moves by swimming 🐟  
- `Bird` → moves by flying 🕊️  
- `Snake` → moves by slithering 🐍  

All classes override the same method `move()` but with different behaviors, showcasing polymorphism in action.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

1. Make sure Python is installed (version 3.x).
2. Copy the code files into a `.py` file (e.g., `main.py`).
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
